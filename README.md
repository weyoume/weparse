## WeParse
The goal of this project is to make data from the WeYouMe, Bitshares, STEEM, and Graphene-based blockchains more accessible to developers, researchers and 3rd party services.

This repo contains utilities for parsing WeYouMe, STEEM and Bitshares blockchain data sets, retrieving price feeds and some extra helpers.

For the main repo behind WeParse functionality, see [steemdata-mongo](https://github.com/SteemData/steemdata-mongo).
